# SimpleApp: Magic the Gathering Commander Match Tracker

SimpleApp is a web application built using the MERN stack. It allows users to record, view, edit, and delete their Commander match records. Beyond match tracking, the application serves as a portfolio showcasing web design insights and an image gallery of various projects I've worked on. The backend is deployed on Render, while the frontend is hosted on Netlify, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience across all devices.
